# interactive tools for video confrences
In business, the use of interactive screens and boards in the meeting room allows
the presenter to take on a different role from that of a simple speaker. This attracts
the attention of the participants and makes the meeting more productive, especially
as several people can write or draw on the same document at the same time.
In the classroom, the interactive whiteboard streamlines lessons by stimulating stu-
dent engagement and enhancing learning. The integration of the tool is quite nat-
ural, as its operation holds no secrets for young people who are already familiar
with technological and computer tools: tablets, smartphones, laptops...

The objective is to make an interactive tool for video conferencing in order to
simulate the dynamics of a two-mode board by considering the computer screen as
a board, one is to write, draw and erase in the board and the other is to manage the
presentation during a conference (back and forth through the slides). Reduce the
cost of equipment.
